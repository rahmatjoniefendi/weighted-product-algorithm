# Weighted Product Algorithm Implementation

## Description

  Algorithm implementation of Weighted Product for handle any problem in any context that match with the usecases of this algorithm, while the required arguments/data must be provided to the algorithm by the user/client/developer/programmer.
  
  The usecases of the algorithm mentioned earlier are followings:
  - Any case that chooses one and the best candidate of multiple candidates by considering weight of each criteria for each variable involved in each candidate
  - Any case that list multiple candidate based on their rank, and also by considering the things mentioned in the previous case

## Project Type
- Experiment

## Status
